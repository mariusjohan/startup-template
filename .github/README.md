## New features
here's a list of what we want to see implemented on the site
* Nice homepage illustrations (i'm thinking something like a many dots or drawings around - just nothing too personal for each website)
* Add testomonials/enterprise customers 
* A proper footer with hyperlinks to all around the page
* Add more views (sign up, sign in)
* Maybe more SEO friendly?
* Add JavaScript to the page
* update navbar to have a burger menu when small
* Add "Why use this service/software" section in main view
